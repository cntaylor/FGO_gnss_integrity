The heart of this code is a database setup as described in [data_structure.md](data_structure.md) and setup in [setup_db.py](setup_db.py).  This database stores satellite .  There are several functions for accessing this database in [meas_db_utils.py](meas_db_utils.py), including a function for creating the database, `create_measurement_database`.  (In other words, `create_measurement_database` is the formal specification of what I attempted to describe in [data_structure.md](data_structure.md).)  An example for creating the database is in [create_meas_database.py](create_meas_database.py).  Currently this uses datasets available at the [libRSF github site](https://github.com/TUC-ProAut/libRSF/tree/master/datasets/).  

The idea is to have real satellite locations and ground-truth (receiver) locations from real data collects.  We can then use the real measurements, or, create our own simulated measurements with known noise characteristics. To see how to create your own Monte Carlo samples, you can see [mc_create_example.py](mc_create_example.py).  To see how to process data, see [L2_estimation_example.py](L2_estimation_example.py).  Processing data can also use the utilities in [comp_utils.py](comp_utils.py).
