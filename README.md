The heart of this code is a database setup as described in [data_structure.md](data_structure.md) and setup in [setup_db.py](setup_db.py).  This database stores satellite and truth location from real-world datasets.  It also allows you to have multiple "Monte Carlo runs" where different pseudo-range values are stored for selected real-world scenarios.

To see how to create your own Monte Carlo samples, you can see [mc_create_example.py](mc_create_example.py).  Do see how to process data, see [L2_estimation_example.py](L2_estimation_example.py).  There are lots of utilities that try to make accessing the database that are found in [meas_db_utils.py](meas_db_utils.py).
