The heart of this code is a database setup as described in [data_structure.md](data_structure.md) and setup in [setup_db.py](setup_db.py).  This database stores satellite and truth location from real-world datasets.  It also allows you to have multiple "Monte Carlo runs" where different pseudo-range values are stored for selected real-world scenarios.  I have code for loading information into the database in [create_meas_database.py](create_meas_database.py).  Currently this uses datasets available at the [libRSF github site](https://github.com/TUC-ProAut/libRSF/tree/master/datasets/).  There are several utilities that try to make accessing the database easier found in [meas_db_utils.py](meas_db_utils.py).

The idea is to have real satellite locations and ground-truth (receiver) locations from real data collects.  We can then use the real measurements, or, create our own simulated measurements with known noise characteristics. To see how to create your own Monte Carlo samples, you can see [mc_create_example.py](mc_create_example.py).  To see how to process data, see [L2_estimation_example.py](L2_estimation_example.py).
